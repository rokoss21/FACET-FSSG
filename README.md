## What is FSSG?

This repository houses **FSSG (FACET Static Site Generator)**‚Äîthe deterministic build engine that turns FACET canonical JSON into production-grade static websites. FSSG concentrates on the generator itself: configuration, build pipeline, renderer, and CLI surface. No guesswork, no hidden state, just reproducible artefacts.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Local development may include a FACET reference checkout for validation, but the `FACET/` tree is git-ignored. Released packages ship only the generator.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install fssg

# Or install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET-FSSG.git
cd FACET-FSSG
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Show help
fssg --help

# Build a site from FACET JSON
fssg build -c config.json

# Watch for changes and rebuild
fssg watch -c config.json

# Validate configuration
fssg validate -c config.json
```

## Why FSSG
- **Determinism by default** ‚Äì Identical sources always produce byte-for-byte identical output. Builds remain diff-friendly, CI stays trustworthy.
- **Safety throughout** ‚Äì Validation enforces the FACET specification end to end. Interpolation in attributes (F304), missing metadata, or unsafe imports are surfaced before anything ships.
- **Intentional interactivity** ‚Äì HTML renders complete without JavaScript. Optional ‚Äúislands‚Äù can be added deliberately, scoped, and audited.
- **Operational clarity** ‚Äì Every stage of the pipeline is explicit‚Äîfrom parse to emit‚Äîso teams can reason about what changed and why.
- **Ready to install** ‚Äì Available on PyPI as [`fssg`](https://pypi.org/project/fssg/1.1.0/) with CLI entrypoint `fssg` and Python 3.9+ support.

## üåê Part of the FACET Ecosystem
FSSG is one layer of a deterministic AI stack maintained by [rokoss21](https://github.com/rokoss21). Each project plays a specific role:

- **[FACET Language](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET)** ‚Äì The contract. A deterministic DSL that compiles human-readable instructions into canonical JSON.
- **[FSSG](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET-FSSG)** ‚Äì The publisher. Consumes FACET JSON to generate trustable artefacts, documentation, and static sites (this repository).
- **[FACET Agents](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET-AGENTS)** ‚Äì The application layer. Declarative agent blueprints that rely on FACET for structure and on FSSG to ship specs, docs, and playbooks.
- **[FACET MCP Server](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET_mcp)** ‚Äì The runtime. A high-performance MCP implementation that executes FACET plans (`execute`), deterministic transformations (`apply_lenses`), and schema validation (`validate_schema`).
- **[RMCP Protocol](https://github.com/rokoss21/rmcp-protocol)** ‚Äì The operating system. An orchestration layer (Facet Engine) that coordinates MCP servers, agents, and policies at scale.

<div align="center">

| Project | Role | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| **[FACET Language](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET)** | Contract Layer | ‚úÖ Active |
| **[FSSG](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET-FSSG)** | Publishing Layer | ‚úÖ Active |
| **[FACET Agents](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET-AGENTS)** | Application Layer | ‚úÖ Active |
| **[FACET MCP Server](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET_mcp)** | Runtime Layer | ‚úÖ Active |
| **[RMCP Protocol](https://github.com/rokoss21/rmcp-protocol)** | Orchestration Layer | ‚úÖ Active |

</div>

Together they form a closed loop: **FACET** defines structure ‚Üí **FSSG** publishes artefacts ‚Üí **MCP** executes plans ‚Üí **Agents** apply them ‚Üí **RMCP** orchestrates everything. Keeping FSSG lean ensures every other layer can depend on identical, reviewable output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or newer (per `fssg/pyproject.toml`).
- Pip / virtualenv recommended.

### Install FSSG (editable mode)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e fssg
```

### Build the demo site
```bash
# from the repository root (virtualenv active)
fssg build -c fssg.config.json
# Static output is written to ./dist/ (ignored by Git)
```

### Run the test suite
```bash
PYTHONPATH=FACET/facet-lang pytest FACET/facet-lang/tests
```

> **Note** ‚Äì Parser and lens tests rely on the local FACET checkout. Production deployments only require the packaged FSSG artefacts.

## Deterministic Workflow Guarantees
1. **Strict parsing** ‚Äì FACET canonical JSON is generated by a specification-aligned canoniser (`facet_lang`).
2. **Safe imports** ‚Äì Relative `@import` statements are resolved against explicit allow-lists with cycle/depth detection.
3. **Type validation** ‚Äì `@var_types` guard the inputs to lenses and template expansion; violations raise the documented FACET error codes.
4. **Idempotent rendering** ‚Äì FSSG renders to HTML with no runtime mutation, zero JavaScript by default, and optional post-processing hooks.
5. **Hermetic outputs** ‚Äì Build artefacts land in `dist/` (gitignored). Rebuilding without source changes reproduces identical files byte-for-byte.

## Development Tips
- Keep experiments inside `archive/`; it stays out of version control while remaining close at hand.
- FACET authoring is strict by design: two-space indentation, no tabs (F002), no attribute interpolation (F304).
- When you tweak canonisation or lenses, update tests alongside‚Äîlocal correctness matters even if the FACET tree is ignored upstream.
- For multi-repo setups, pass explicit `--import-root` / `current_file` to `canonize` so relative imports remain sandboxed.

## Philosophy at a Glance
- **Tooling as contract** ‚Äì The FACET specification is the contract. FSSG implements it faithfully so humans and automation share the same deterministic language.
- **Audit-friendly diagnostics** ‚Äì Error codes such as `F304`, `H101`, `P101` make build logs readable and actionable.
- **Composable outputs** ‚Äì Multiple render targets (`html`, `islands`, `react`) are fed by one canonical JSON tree, eliminating divergence.
- **Future-proof defaults** ‚Äì Critical CSS, precompression, strict CSP, and accessibility affordances ship as defaults rather than optional extras.

## Learn More Across the Stack
- Read the [FACET specification](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET) to understand the language contract that feeds FSSG.
- Explore the [FACET Agents](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET-AGENTS) repository for real-world blueprints authored in FACET and published via FSSG.
- Integrate deterministic tooling into AI assistants with the [FACET MCP Server](https://github.com/rokoss21/FACET_mcp).
- See how large fleets of tools and agents are coordinated using the [RMCP Protocol](https://github.com/rokoss21/rmcp-protocol).

Each layer reinforces the others: FACET defines intent, FSSG publishes truth, MCP executes plans, and RMCP orchestrates them at scale.

## Releasing
1. Run the full FACET test suite.
2. Build the reference site (`fssg build -c fssg.config.json`) and spot-check output.
3. Tag versions consistently for both subprojects (`FACET/__init__`, `fssg/__init__`, `pyproject.toml`).
4. Publish packages (PyPI or internal registry) from the clean tree with no pending artefacts. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) for step-by-step instructions using PyPI API tokens.
